I experience a ton of similar symptoms as well and it\\u2019s horrible given I have severe hypochondria. Any bodily sensation that feels just a tiny bit off sets off the entire alarm system in me and I just end up spiralling.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s great to hear that there are others out there that feel or have the exact same symptoms. Makes the journey feel much less terrifying and alone. And I know that I\\u2019m not actually dying! Thanks for this and big hugs!\",\n          \"Hello everyone. I\\u2019m currently recovering from GAD. It\\u2019s been a challenge. I\\u2019m a commercial pilot and the stress from work and personal life took a big toll on my life these last two years. I impulsively resigned from a job that I enjoyed. The job did have some stress involved, but for the most part I really enjoyed it. I am recovering from GAD, however, trying to get my job back has been very stressful which doesn\\u2019t help me as I\\u2019m trying to recover. I was at that job for close to 23 years.\\u00a0\\n\\nThe symptoms I experienced last year before I eventually sought help in July of this year was brain fog, dizziness, loss of concentration, unable to focus, my cognitive ability to think rationally and make decisions was impaired . Tension headaches, trembling, tinnitus, worrying constantly, insomnia, fatigue, claustrophobia, a feeling of not able to control my decisions and now I have this former employer that won\\u2019t take me back because I was in a vulnerable state of mind to have people convince me to leave for another job that I didn\\u2019t want because I\\u2019m getting close to retirement. So, now I have two hills to climb during my recovery. I really didn\\u2019t need this. None of us do!\\n\\nI was so cognitively out of it when I left my former employer that I didn\\u2019t realize what I was doing starting over again until the first week of the new job. I finally realized that this is not my old job and that there is something mentally wrong with me. The best decision I made was to seek help. However, I was longer at my former job. This is going to be a real challenge.\\u00a0\\n\\nThe symptoms I had described earlier, I had gone to the doctor last year to see what was wrong with me. I thought I may have long covid because I had covid in 2020 and 2022. The PCR tests came back negative and I was diagnosed with a viral infection. So, when I wasn\\u2019t flying I would take Sudafed to help with the dizziness, but the dizziness still came back. I thought there may have been loose crystals in my vestibular system, so I tried repositioning them by laying down and moving my head side to side. No change. I saw the doctor again. Same diagnosis. Eventually, I just delt with it not realizing that it was GAD that was causing these symptoms. Unfortunately, it took losing a good job to find out what I was dealing with.\\u00a0\\n\\nYes, this really sux, but I can\\u2019t let this beat me. All I can do is continue receiving treatment and use my coping skills to fight this disorder. As for my former job, it\\u2019s going to a challenge to getting it back. Whats sad is that mental health issues are a stigma in aviation, so pilots are less willing to fess up and seek help until it\\u2019s too late. I sought help, but the doctors never determined that it could be psychological. After I had left my former employer and I realized that there was a problem with me my symptoms sky rocketed and I became a mental mess. But I never gave up. Believe me there are days that I wonder why this happened to me, but I keep telling myself to not give up. This is just another challenge to prove to how vulnerable our lives can be and that we can beat this through professional and peer support.\\n\\nNever quit. Never give up\",\n          \"Though feeling all of these symptoms is incredibly draining, it oddly feels nice to know that I\\u2019m not alone. My anxiety often makes me feel like I\\u2019m alone, so just knowing that we\\u2019re all in the same boat together helps me feel a bit less alone.

I would appreciate any assistance or guidance you can offer. Here is a timeline of my experiences:\\n\\n1. \\nI've been dealing with anxiety symptoms for approximately six years now. It all began during a period in my life filled with stressful situations. At the time, my diet was poor, and I was smoking cigarettes frequently. The symptoms initially manifested as high blood pressure, headaches, heart palpitations, a tight chest sensation lasting three months, lethargy, sweating, and occasional difficulty breathing.\\n\\nInitially, doctors suspected blood pressure issues due to my high cholesterol levels and prescribed statins. However, the medication didn't provide much relief, although I did gradually improve over time.\\n\\n2. \\nSix months later, I started experiencing new symptoms, including feelings of fear, a sensation of eyes being pressed into my head, neck pains, and fatigue. Fortunately, these symptoms subsided after about a month.\\nAnother five months passed, and I began experiencing intense pressure at the back and top of my head, as well as the feeling of eyes being pressed into my head. These debilitating headaches persisted for four months, and nothing seemed to alleviate them.\\n\\n3. \\nA year later, during the COVID-19 pandemic when mask-wearing became widespread, I started experiencing air hunger, a feeling of not being able to breathe fully. I believe the masks exacerbated this symptom, leading me to seek treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). I started with Lexapro for five months, which initially caused dizziness and unpleasant withdrawal effects such as brain zaps. However, it ultimately helped alleviate all my symptoms, including the air hunger.\\n\\n4. \\nUnfortunately, four months later, the air hunger returned, accompanied by panic attacks. I've only had two panic attacks in my life, a few days apart. Additionally, I began experiencing mental symptoms for the first time, such as depressive sadness, apathy, and alarming sensations, particularly upon waking up. After trying various vitamins and minerals without success, I resumed taking Lexapro at lower doses for four months, which provided relief once again.\\n\\n5. \\nThen, after six months, I started experiencing a new symptom. Following a flight to another country, I developed extreme fatigue, characterized by a combination of lethargy, weakness, and a feeling of heaviness in my body, as if gravity became significantly stronger. This lasted for ten days and triggered anxiety, causing the return of symptoms like the sensation of eyes being pressed into my head, heart palpitations, and high blood pressure. However, I didn't take any medication this time, and the symptoms eventually subsided on their own.\\n\\n6. \\nTwo months later, the air hunger returned, accompanied by fatigue, dizziness, and lightheadedness. The persistent fatigue and constant lightheadedness were particularly distressing, and during this period, I also experienced depersonalization/derealization for the first time, which was extremely frightening. My neurologist diagnosed it as \\\"asthenic vegetative syndrome\\\" and assured me that it would pass. However, I requested medication and was prescribed phenibut. I've been taking phenibut for two months now, and although some symptoms like the sensation of eyes being pressed into my head, air hunger, fatigue, and joint pains persist, they are not as severe.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis has been an incredibly long journey, and I'm unable to prevent these symptoms from reoccurring. My everyday life isn't particularly stressful, and I don't experience anxiety regularly. Instead, these physical symptoms seem to arise unexpectedly, triggering anxiety and perpetuating a cycle.\\n\\nI also sometimes experience this crazy symptom where it feels like I need to be somewhere immediately in the moment while having strong apathy at the same time. Difficult to describe. \\n\\n\\nI am 28 years old now. Male. Weigh 73kgs. Have been healthy all my life. Just to inform you, throughout all of the above, I had been tested regularly. Blood tests, scans, mris, absolutely everything you can think of. And every time my tests were good. \\nI don\\u2019t wanna keep taking SSRIs as the organism gets used to it while it doesn\\u2019t fix anything. \\n\\nCouple of things helped. Stopped caffeine for good this last time and helped a lot but not fully. Tried magnesium all of the times. Sometimes it helps sometimes not much. Many various magnesium forms. Tried omega 3, b vitamin complexes, ashwaganda. Also tried a therapist. Didn\\u2019t help me much as she kept going on about my past. I do agree that it is likely that I am so vulnerable to anxiety because of my childhood, but none of that helps my anxiety now. \\n\\nI exercise regularly. Cardio, weightlifting and swimming. \\n\\nHere is a list of ALL of my symptoms from light to severe ones:\\n\\n- feeling of fire in stomach+throat \\n- annoyed \\n- sweating \\n- high blood pressure (around 160/90 being highest) \\n- brain fog \\n- pessimistic \\n- feeling of heavy head \\n- feeling of eyes being heavy\\n- constant worry about symptoms not going away and trying to find relief \\n- insomnia \\n- neck pain \\n- rush of adrenaline feeling in chest \\n- air hunger ( not being able to take a deep breath and constantly yawning) \\n- eyes being pressed into the head feeling\\n- panic attacks \\n- d\\u00e9r\\u00e9alisation \\n\\n\\nPLEASE HELP REDDIT. would love to find someone who has experienced any likely symptoms, or someone who could help me with advice. It does affect my life dearly. I am scared of travelling anywhere by myself as the symptoms could begin again out of nowhere and I would feel out of control and helpless. \\n\\nThanks ! \\n\\nTLDR: have had various anxiety physical symptoms on and off throughout 6 years. Won\\u2019t go away.\",\n          \"I've got so many.

(annoying symptom). compulsions: reassurance seeking. constant googling. . depersonalizion derealization: this was one of the worst ones. this has symptoms tied to it. everything looks d, flat, and like a video game. felt like i was outside of my body permanately. was so scared of looking at people because they looked alien like. couldnt look in the mirror for over year. felt like a zombie because of this. difficulty concentrating, speaking, writing, following conversations. felt incapabale of using my brain some days. . dissociation: out of body type feeling. super weird. had it happen many times because of dpdr. . brain chatter: brain doesnt stop talking. music in my head, thoughts, words, conversations etc. its like my brain doesnt have a damn off button. super scary at first but now its just annoying and barely happens. this is a common ocd symptom. ear worm: constant music playing in my head - felt like i was going nuts but it went away thankfully. brain zaps: feeling a shock like feeling in your brain and head. one time it felt like a lightning strike and i seen a huge flash in my eyes. insomnia: couldnt sleep for so many days. short term memory loss: kept forgetting everything. brushed my teeth times in hours one day. dpdr caused this symptom badly. emotional numbness anhedonia. a feeling of not feeling anything for anyone or anything. its not depression but it feels similar. very weird symptom. felt like a zombie here. depression. hypnagogic and hypnapompic hallucinations. feeling of crawling in your skin. weird high excessive energy and then low depression like energy. . getting sick all the team. this was so damn annoying. i was sick every other week. my bodys immune system was so weak. . feeling of dropping in an elevator. severe hypervigalance. like there is a threat somewhere and everywhere. this was caused horribly by ocd for me. vertigo awake and sleeping visual symptoms. eye floaters. annoying little cobwebs in your eyes. visual snow. this one is annoying. static across your vision, eye floaters, flashes of lights, ghosting, colored blobs, black blobs all over your vision. . blurred vision or blurry vision. . tunnel vision. intense pain in eyes. ocular migraines. weird migraines. depth perception issues: things looked zoomed in and or things seem like they shrunk. this only happens at night when i wake up, could be part of hypnagogic hallucinations. hearing symptoms. tinnitus. low humming, high pitched frequency, vibrations, so many different sounds for this. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
