I would appreciate any assistance or guidance you can offer. Here is a timeline of my experiences:\\n\\n1. \\nI've been dealing with anxiety symptoms for approximately six years now. It all began during a period in my life filled with stressful situations. At the time, my diet was poor, and I was smoking cigarettes frequently. The symptoms initially manifested as high blood pressure, headaches, heart palpitations, a tight chest sensation lasting three months, lethargy, sweating, and occasional difficulty breathing.\\n\\nInitially, doctors suspected blood pressure issues due to my high cholesterol levels and prescribed statins. However, the medication didn't provide much relief, although I did gradually improve over time.\\n\\n2. \\nSix months later, I started experiencing new symptoms, including feelings of fear, a sensation of eyes being pressed into my head, neck pains, and fatigue. Fortunately, these symptoms subsided after about a month.\\nAnother five months passed, and I began experiencing intense pressure at the back and top of my head, as well as the feeling of eyes being pressed into my head. These debilitating headaches persisted for four months, and nothing seemed to alleviate them.\\n\\n3. \\nA year later, during the COVID-19 pandemic when mask-wearing became widespread, I started experiencing air hunger, a feeling of not being able to breathe fully. I believe the masks exacerbated this symptom, leading me to seek treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). I started with Lexapro for five months, which initially caused dizziness and unpleasant withdrawal effects such as brain zaps. However, it ultimately helped alleviate all my symptoms, including the air hunger.\\n\\n4. \\nUnfortunately, four months later, the air hunger returned, accompanied by panic attacks. I've only had two panic attacks in my life, a few days apart. Additionally, I began experiencing mental symptoms for the first time, such as depressive sadness, apathy, and alarming sensations, particularly upon waking up. After trying various vitamins and minerals without success, I resumed taking Lexapro at lower doses for four months, which provided relief once again.\\n\\n5. \\nThen, after six months, I started experiencing a new symptom. Following a flight to another country, I developed extreme fatigue, characterized by a combination of lethargy, weakness, and a feeling of heaviness in my body, as if gravity became significantly stronger. This lasted for ten days and triggered anxiety, causing the return of symptoms like the sensation of eyes being pressed into my head, heart palpitations, and high blood pressure. However, I didn't take any medication this time, and the symptoms eventually subsided on their own.\\n\\n6. \\nTwo months later, the air hunger returned, accompanied by fatigue, dizziness, and lightheadedness. The persistent fatigue and constant lightheadedness were particularly distressing, and during this period, I also experienced depersonalization/derealization for the first time, which was extremely frightening. My neurologist diagnosed it as \\\"asthenic vegetative syndrome\\\" and assured me that it would pass. However, I requested medication and was prescribed phenibut. I've been taking phenibut for two months now, and although some symptoms like the sensation of eyes being pressed into my head, air hunger, fatigue, and joint pains persist, they are not as severe.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis has been an incredibly long journey, and I'm unable to prevent these symptoms from reoccurring. My everyday life isn't particularly stressful, and I don't experience anxiety regularly. Instead, these physical symptoms seem to arise unexpectedly, triggering anxiety and perpetuating a cycle.\\n\\nI also sometimes experience this crazy symptom where it feels like I need to be somewhere immediately in the moment while having strong apathy at the same time. Difficult to describe. \\n\\n\\nI am 28 years old now. Male. Weigh 73kgs. Have been healthy all my life. Just to inform you, throughout all of the above, I had been tested regularly. Blood tests, scans, mris, absolutely everything you can think of. And every time my tests were good. \\nI don\\u2019t wanna keep taking SSRIs as the organism gets used to it while it doesn\\u2019t fix anything. \\n\\nCouple of things helped. Stopped caffeine for good this last time and helped a lot but not fully. Tried magnesium all of the times. Sometimes it helps sometimes not much. Many various magnesium forms. Tried omega 3, b vitamin complexes, ashwaganda. Also tried a therapist. Didn\\u2019t help me much as she kept going on about my past. I do agree that it is likely that I am so vulnerable to anxiety because of my childhood, but none of that helps my anxiety now. \\n\\nI exercise regularly. Cardio, weightlifting and swimming. \\n\\nHere is a list of ALL of my symptoms from light to severe ones:\\n\\n- feeling of fire in stomach+throat \\n- annoyed \\n- sweating \\n- high blood pressure (around 160/90 being highest) \\n- brain fog \\n- pessimistic \\n- feeling of heavy head \\n- feeling of eyes being heavy\\n- constant worry about symptoms not going away and trying to find relief \\n- insomnia \\n- neck pain \\n- rush of adrenaline feeling in chest \\n- air hunger ( not being able to take a deep breath and constantly yawning) \\n- eyes being pressed into the head feeling\\n- panic attacks \\n- d\\u00e9r\\u00e9alisation \\n\\n\\nPLEASE HELP REDDIT. would love to find someone who has experienced any likely symptoms, or someone who could help me with advice. It does affect my life dearly. I am scared of travelling anywhere by myself as the symptoms could begin again out of nowhere and I would feel out of control and helpless. \\n\\nThanks ! \\n\\nTLDR: have had various anxiety physical symptoms on and off throughout 6 years. Won\\u2019t go away.\",\n          \"I've got so many. Muscle twitching all over, TMJ, hypnic jerks, stomach pain, eye floaters, a 3 week long head ache, throat tension.\\n\\nI have had seveare anxiety day in day out for over a year. Has been hell. \",\n          \"Anxiety easily can cause a million different symptoms. I made a near full recovery and one of the worst things I had to deal with was the symptoms. Dealing with symptoms is an endless cycle that seems to never end. When I lost the fear of 1 symptom, I had a new one the next week. Its important to understand these symptoms because it takes away the power they have over you. Here is a SHORT list of the symptoms I had. I easily had 100+ symptoms, and I am leaving out the dpdr and ocd symptoms. I have recovered 95% from all of this. Feel free to ask me about any of these symptoms!

for my strange anxiety journey! over the past six years, i ve visited numerous doctors, but unfortunately, none have been particularly helpful. i would appreciate any assistance or guidance you can offer. here is a timeline of my experiences:. i ve been dealing with anxiety symptoms for approximately six years now. it all began during a period in my life filled with stressful situations. at the time, my diet was poor, and i was smoking cigarettes frequently. the symptoms initially manifested as high blood pressure, headaches, heart palpitations, a tight chest sensation lasting three months, lethargy, sweating, and occasional difficulty breathing. initially, doctors suspected blood pressure issues due to my high cholesterol levels and prescribed statins. however, the medication didn t provide much relief, although i did gradually improve over time. . six months later, i started experiencing new symptoms, including feelings of fear, a sensation of eyes being pressed into my head, neck pains, and fatigue. fortunately, these symptoms subsided after about a month. another five months passed, and i began experiencing intense pressure at the back and top of my head, as well as the feeling of eyes being pressed into my head. these debilitating headaches persisted for four months, and nothing seemed to alleviate them. . a year later, during the covid- pandemic when mask-wearing became widespread, i started experiencing air hunger, a feeling of not being able to breathe fully. i believe the masks exacerbated this symptom, leading me to seek treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris). i started with lexapro for five months, which initially caused dizziness and unpleasant withdrawal effects such as brain zaps. however, it ultimately helped alleviate all my symptoms, including the air hunger. . unfortunately, four months later, the air hunger returned, accompanied by panic attacks. i ve only had two panic attacks in my life, a few days apart. additionally, i began experiencing mental symptoms for the first time, such as depressive sadness, apathy, and alarming sensations, particularly upon waking up. after trying various vitamins and minerals without success, i resumed taking lexapro at lower doses for four months, which provided relief once again. . then, after six months, i started experiencing a new symptom. following a flight to another country, i developed extreme fatigue, characterized by a combination of lethargy, weakness, and a feeling of heaviness in my body, as if gravity became significantly stronger. this lasted for ten days and triggered anxiety, causing the return of symptoms like the sensation of eyes being pressed into my head, heart palpitations, and high blood pressure. however, i didn t take any medication this time, and the symptoms eventually subsided on their own. . two months later, the air hunger returned, accompanied by fatigue, dizziness, and lightheadedness. the persistent fatigue and constant lightheadedness were particularly distressing, and during this period, i also experienced depersonalization derealization for the first time, which was extremely frightening. my neurologist diagnosed it as asthenic vegetative syndrome and assured me that it would pass. however, i requested medication and was prescribed phenibut. i ve been taking phenibut for two months now, and although some symptoms like the sensation of eyes being pressed into my head, air hunger, fatigue, and joint pains persist, they are not as severe. this has been an incredibly long journey, and i m unable to prevent these symptoms from reoccurring. my everyday life isn t particularly stressful, and i don t experience anxiety regularly. instead, these physical symptoms seem to arise unexpectedly, triggering anxiety and perpetuating a cycle. i also sometimes experience this crazy symptom where it feels like i need to be somewhere immediately in the moment while having strong apathy at the same time. difficult to describe. i am years old now. male. weigh kgs. have been healthy all my life. just to inform you, throughout all of the above, i had been tested regularly. blood tests, scans, mris, absolutely everything you can think of. and every time my tests were good. i don t wanna keep taking ssris as the organism gets used to it while it doesn t fix anything. couple of things helped. stopped caffeine for good this last time and helped a lot but not fully. tried magnesium all of the times. sometimes it helps sometimes not much. many various magnesium forms. tried omega , b vitamin complexes, ashwaganda. also tried a therapist. didn t help me much as she kept going on about my past. i do agree that it is likely that i am so vulnerable to anxiety because of my childhood, but none of that helps my anxiety now. i exercise regularly. cardio, weightlifting and swimming. here is a list of all of my symptoms from light to severe ones: - feeling of fire in stomach throat - annoyed - sweating - high blood pressure (around being highest) - brain fog - pessimistic - feeling of heavy head - feeling of eyes being heavy - constant worry about symptoms not going away and trying to find relief - insomnia - neck pain - rush of adrenaline feeling in chest - air hunger ( not being able to take a deep breath and constantly yawning) - eyes being pressed into the head feeling - panic attacks - derealisation please help reddit. would love to find someone who has experienced any likely symptoms, or someone who could help me with advice. it does affect my life dearly. i am scared of travelling anywhere by myself as the symptoms could begin again out of nowhere and i would feel out of control and helpless. thanks! tldr: have had various anxiety physical symptoms on and off throughout years. won t go away. \",\n          \"i ve got so many. muscle twitching all over, tmj, hypnic jerks, stomach pain, eye floaters, a week long head ache, throat tension. i have had seveare anxiety day in day out for over a year. has been hell. \",\n          \"anxiety easily can cause a million different symptoms. i made a near full recovery and one of the worst things i had to deal
