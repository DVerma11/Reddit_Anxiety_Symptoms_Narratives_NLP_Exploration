1czzuoo,Anxiety,Here is a full list of anxiety symptoms I dealt with during my anxiety recovery journey,"Anxiety easily can cause a million different symptoms. I made a near full recovery and one of the worst things I had to deal with was the symptoms. Dealing with symptoms is an endless cycle that seems to never end. When I lost the fear of 1 symptom, I had a new one the next week. Its important to understand these symptoms because it takes away the power they have over you. Here is a SHORT list of the symptoms I had. I easily had 100+ symptoms, and I am leaving out the dpdr and ocd symptoms. I have recovered 95% from all of this. Feel free to ask me about any of these symptoms! Edit, please checkout my page which has all resources for free. It’s on my Reddit profile!

Mine are categorized under three areas:

PRIMARY:
1: feeling like I can’t swallow. Like there’s a ball in my throat. 

2: worry. I tend to worry about everything. Then my brain starts creating realities for something that hasn’t happened or happened already. 


SECONDARY:
1: chest tightness. This scares me because I’m
Asthmatic. So I start to freak out. 

2: feeling like I can’t take a deep breath. This often times comes with the feeling of not being able to swallow. 


RARE:
1: chest pain. This does happen but super rarely. 

2: super fast heart rate! This also (thankfully) happens super rarely but when it does my heart rate will spike to like 160 bpm.

10jcfko,Anxiety,Long-Term Anxiety Symptoms I Had! (from someone who has recovered/been free from them for 1+ year),"Long-Term Anxiety/Long-term Stress Symptoms
I wanted to make a post in hopes to help a lot of you who are experiencing very strange, scary and difficult symptoms that you may not realise are a product of long-term and cyclical anxiety/health anxiety/stress. I felt inspired to make this post as even to this day, I am getting comments and messages on some of my previous posts about how I've made people feel better, less afraid and less alone as I've made their symptoms feel heard and like they are finally feeling safe and that what they are experiencing won't hurt them.

For small context of my story, I developed random Agoraphobia in late 2019, which escalated into very bad health anxiety through all of 2020 and some of 2021, all because of one singular panic attack. One panic attack that I misread for something serious, turned into a feedback loop of anxiety which ended up producing very scary, bizzare, and difficult symptoms. I have been free of these symptoms for what will have been over a year now as of this year after tackling my anxiety, and I'd love to help all of you feel at ease if you have any of these!

You don't have to be actively panicking or anxious to experience these, your body holds onto long-term built up anxiety/stress, it doesn't flush it all out immediately so you can experience these anytime after prolonged periods of these emotions. It gets much, much better over time.

- Dizziness (like the inside of your head is spinning but your vision isn't, sometimes to the point where you can't sit up or if you close your eyes it feels like you're spinning)

- Fuzzy Strange Head Feeling, wooziness, heaviness in the head
- Like the ground feels wobbly/like you'll fall over/like you're on a boat, like I'd fall through the floor

- Brain Zaps (without the presence of SSRI's. It'd feel like an elevator dropped inside my head, my head would 'zing' a lot, sometimes my vision would black out, my head would drop, I thought only SSRI withdrawal could do this but I found out thats not the case. I felt crazy.)

- Head Pressure or headaches (extreme pressure headaches that felt like it was constantly expanding, like I wanted to squeeze my head, so much pain, sharp pain, tension)

- Electricity feeling in the back of the neck at the base of the head (made me think I had MS)

- Derealization/Depersonalization (everything felt either too close or too far away, like everything wasn't real, looking at people felt like they were 2D cut-outs, nothing felt real or right, like the world was slipping away, this was my scariest symptom and worried it was permenant. I've never experienced it again since 2020, and I feel like my old self again)
**Edit 27th September 2023: I have finally made a big post on my DPDR recovery story, as well as advice, symptoms, reassuring facts/advice** https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/16thenk/how_i_overcame_dpdr_symptoms_feedback_loop/?

- Choking/Strangling Sensation in the throat or around the throat/gagging/globus sensation/neck tightness or stiffness

- Increased Phosphene Activity (for example, when you rub your eyes or press on closed eyes you see 'fireworks' or 'lights', I'd see them much more at night with my eyes closed trying to sleep, and they'd sometimes make shapes or patterns)

- Hypnagogic/Hypnapompic Hallucinations (not indicative of psychosis, normal phenomenon, its when you see afterimages at night just before sleeping or the second you wake up. I'd sometimes have a digital alarm clock afterimage stuck in my vision for a minute)

- Strange pulsing light around field of vision at night after opening eyes

- Increase in Afterimages (they've severely decreased since getting better/I don't notice if I have any anymore. I used to focus on them like crazy)

- Visual Snow (had it all my life, but it felt 'increased' during my anxiety. Truth is I was just focusing on it more and now I never notice it again)

- Random black dot in vision, disappears when I look at it (I don't get this at all anymore but it used to be constant)

- Tinnitus (again, had all my life but was 'worse' during my extreme anxiety. Its since got better greatly since I felt better)

- Floaters in vision (I don't get these but these are extraordinarily common in people with anxiety)

- Chest Tightness, Chest Pain, Ectopic Beats, Palpitations, Tingling in hands

- Feeling Hungry for Air, like you can't get a full satisfying breath, shortness of breath sensation

- Sleep Paralysis Increase

- Lots of random pain, soreness in any part of the body suddenly, ranges from sharp to dull, just always in pain one way or another (I'd get zygomatic pain, to my neck being tender)

- Tense jaw, like it couldn't relax

- Stomach pain, stomach upsetness, nausea, bowel urgency

- Feeling like your speech is slurred, slow or like your brain is lagging

- Increased Vivid dreams, hyperawareness of sleep sensations (such as racing train of thought, nonsense thoughts as your brain winds down for sleep), hypnic jerks

- Eye Pain/eye pressure, pain moving eyes around, pain in the socket

- Random feelings of dread, feeling like you are about to die/something is wrong

These are just some of the symptoms I remember off the top of my head, definitely leave comments if there's any you're experiencing that I haven't noted as I can also try to let you know if I had those symptoms, or if other Redditors have!

It took me longer than I'd like to admit that these are just symptoms of anxiety and not something greater; I was a non-stop Googler of every symptom and sensation and decided I had every disease under the sun like Meniere's Disease, MS, brain tumours, schizophrenia (even though I had absolutely no symptoms of it) etc. I felt like I was going to be like this forever, it affected me everyday of my waking life, I kept a diary everyday of my symptoms and how I felt until one day I never wrote in it again because I never had anything to write about. I got better, it gets better, you are all safe, you are not alone.

I'd be super happy to answer any questions, or to help any of you feel assured so please feel free to leave anything by that could get you the help or support you need.

........................................................

**Edit 2 (17th January 2024)**
Hiya everyone!

I just wanted to say thank you so much to all of you who are still using this place as a resource, and a safe place to come to me for advice and reassurance!

**For future reference I'd really recommend that if any of you have questions, or need advice, that you reply to this thread instead of sending me private messages and I'll explain why!**

1. Its easier & faster for me to get back to you! When you make a comment I get a notification which allows me to see your concerns instantly. **When a private message is sent, it immediately goes into my 'Message Requests' which I never get a notification for and have to actively remember to check it everyday (which can be hard!). I've got over 40 message requests now, which has left me quite swamped and feeling helpless because I didn't see them sooner and don't know where to start/if I can. So I'd really recommend at least leaving a comment first in the thread before messaging me privately. I want to help!**

2. Leaving a comment means that other people can read your questions, and they can also read my answers! This allows people to find answers to their questions easier as they may have the same question in their minds that has been asked before, and they can find that its been asked & answered. This stops a flood of repeat questions, and allows public access of all the information and experiences I can provide. **It is absolutely imperative to me that all of the information, advice and questions here remain completely public, free of charge and can be revisitable.**

3. **I can understand some of what you may want to talk about is more private/personal, so in this case please leave a comment requesting to message me and allow me to give you permission to message me before you send a private message.** This allows me to remember to check my message requests, and confirms that I can give you the attention and shoulder to lean on that you may need. There are times I will be absent due to personal commitments and real life, so I want to be able to reassure you on when I have the time to get back to you.

Again, I just wanted to say thank you and that I am insanely grateful for and proud of everyone here. I hope you know this is written in good faith and not to shame anybody, **I just want to help all of you as much as I can so making it easier to navigate and accessible means that more people can get the help they need x**",716,0.99,693,1674480319.0,700,319,1674482290.0,1765481912.0,2023-01-23 13:58:10,2025-12-11 19:38:32,2023-01-23 13:25:19

13nzoyr,Anxiety,Long term ongoing physical anxiety symptoms.,"Get ready for my strange anxiety journey!


Over the past six years, I've visited numerous doctors, but unfortunately, none have been particularly helpful. I would appreciate any assistance or guidance you can offer. Here is a timeline of my experiences:

1. 
I've been dealing with anxiety symptoms for approximately six years now. It all began during a period in my life filled with stressful situations. At the time, my diet was poor, and I was smoking cigarettes frequently. The symptoms initially manifested as high blood pressure, headaches, heart palpitations, a tight chest sensation lasting three months, lethargy, sweating, and occasional difficulty breathing.

Initially, doctors suspected blood pressure issues due to my high cholesterol levels and prescribed statins. However, the medication didn't provide much relief, although I did gradually improve over time.

2. 
Six months later, I started experiencing new symptoms, including feelings of fear, a sensation of eyes being pressed into my head, neck pains, and fatigue. Fortunately, these symptoms subsided after about a month.
Another five months passed, and I began experiencing intense pressure at the back and top of my head, as well as the feeling of eyes being pressed into my head. These debilitating headaches persisted for four months, and nothing seemed to alleviate them.

3. 
A year later, during the COVID-19 pandemic when mask-wearing became widespread, I started experiencing air hunger, a feeling of not being able to breathe fully. I believe the masks exacerbated this symptom, leading me to seek treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). I started with Lexapro for five months, which initially caused dizziness and unpleasant withdrawal effects such as brain zaps. However, it ultimately helped alleviate all my symptoms, including the air hunger.

4. 
Unfortunately, four months later, the air hunger returned, accompanied by panic attacks. I've only had two panic attacks in my life, a few days apart. Additionally, I began experiencing mental symptoms for the first time, such as depressive sadness, apathy, and alarming sensations, particularly upon waking up. After trying various vitamins and minerals without success, I resumed taking Lexapro at lower doses for four months, which provided relief once again.

5. 
Then, after six months, I started experiencing a new symptom. Following a flight to another country, I developed extreme fatigue, characterized by a combination of lethargy, weakness, and a feeling of heaviness in my body, as if gravity became significantly stronger. This lasted for ten days and triggered anxiety, causing the return of symptoms like the sensation of eyes being pressed into my head, heart palpitations, and high blood pressure. However, I didn't take any medication this time, and the symptoms eventually subsided on their own.

6. 
Two months later, the air hunger returned, accompanied by fatigue, dizziness, and lightheadedness. The persistent fatigue and constant lightheadedness were particularly distressing, and during this period, I also experienced depersonalization/derealization for the first time, which was extremely frightening. My neurologist diagnosed it as ""asthenic vegetative syndrome"" and assured me that it would pass. However, I requested medication and was prescribed phenibut. I've been taking phenibut for two months now, and although some symptoms like the sensation of eyes being pressed into my head, air hunger, fatigue, and joint pains persist, they are not as severe.



This has been an incredibly long journey, and I'm unable to prevent these symptoms from reoccurring. My everyday life isn't particularly stressful, and I don't experience anxiety regularly. Instead, these physical symptoms seem to arise unexpectedly, triggering anxiety and perpetuating a cycle.

I also sometimes experience this crazy symptom where it feels like I need to be somewhere immediately in the moment while having strong apathy at the same time. Difficult to describe. 


I am 28 years old now. Male. Weigh 73kgs. Have been healthy all my life. Just to inform you, throughout all of the above, I had been tested regularly. Blood tests, scans, mris, absolutely everything you can think of. And every time my tests were good. 
I don’t wanna keep taking SSRIs as the organism gets used to it while it doesn’t fix anything. 

Couple of things helped. Stopped caffeine for good this last time and helped a lot but not fully. Tried magnesium all of the times. Sometimes it helps sometimes not much. Many various magnesium forms. Tried omega 3, b vitamin complexes, ashwaganda. Also tried a therapist. Didn’t help me much as she kept going on about my past. I do agree that it is likely that I am so vulnerable to anxiety because of my childhood, but none of that helps my anxiety now. 

I exercise regularly. Cardio, weightlifting and swimming. 

Here is a list of ALL of my symptoms from light to severe ones:

- feeling of fire in stomach+throat 
- annoyed 
- sweating 
- high blood pressure (around 160/90 being highest) 
- brain fog 
- pessimistic 
- feeling of heavy head 
- feeling of eyes being heavy
- constant worry about symptoms not going away and trying to find relief 
- insomnia 
- neck pain 
- rush of adrenaline feeling in chest 
- air hunger ( not being able to take a deep breath and constantly yawning) 
- eyes being pressed into the head feeling
- panic attacks 
- déréalisation 


PLEASE HELP REDDIT. would love to find someone who has experienced any likely symptoms, or someone who could help me with advice. It does affect my life dearly. I am scared of travelling anywhere by myself as the symptoms could begin again out of nowhere and I would feel out of control and helpless.
